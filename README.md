TYPES Of API
SQL-based APIs – These APIs allow applications to send SQL queries to a database (e.g., MySQL Connector, PostgreSQL’s psycopg2).
ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) APIs – These provide an abstraction layer over SQL, allowing developers to interact with databases using objects and methods (e.g., SQLAlchemy for Python, Hibernate for Java).
RESTful/GraphQL Database APIs – These expose the database via web-based APIs, allowing applications to interact with it using HTTP requests (e.g., Firebase, Hasura).
Cloud Database APIs – Services like AWS RDS, Google Firestore, and Supabase provide APIs for managing and querying databases.

HOW EASY IS IT?
If you're comfortable with SQL, using a database API like MySQL Connector (for Python) should be relatively straightforward.
If you're new to databases, using an ORM (e.g., SQLAlchemy, Django ORM) can make things easier by handling SQL queries for you.
REST/GraphQL APIs are beginner-friendly if you're already familiar with web APIs, as they allow database interactions using simple HTTP requests. 

ORM SQL ALchemy. 
No need to write raw SQL
Easier and safer (prevents SQL injection)
Works with multiple databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.)
